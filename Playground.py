# Welcome to Python playground

# Comments on single lines are made with #

# We can print to console using print e.g

print("Hello World!")

# Printing two string together

print("Hello " + "Flynn")

# Creating variables

todays_date = 22
todays_day = "Wednesday"

# Arithmetic in python

multiply = 4 * 4
divide = 4 / 2
add = 4 + 4
subtract = 4 - 2
remainder = 4 % 3

print(multiply)

# Updating Variables
# example using annual rainfall

annual_rainfall = january_to_june_rainfall

july_rainfall = 1.05
annual_rainfall += july_rainfall

august_rainfall = 4.91
annual_rainfall += august_rainfall

september_rainfall = 5.16
annual_rainfall += september_rainfall

october_rainfall = 7.20
annual_rainfall += october_rainfall

november_rainfall = 5.06
annual_rainfall += november_rainfall

december_rainfall = 4.06
annual_rainfall += december_rainfall

# Numbers

# Integers are numbers with no decimal point E.G

int1 = 1
int2 = 2
int3 = -3

print(int1, ",", int2, ",", int3)

# Float is a number with a decimal point
# You can also use "e" when declaring to indicate the power of 10

float1 = 1.0
float2 = 10.0
float3 = -5.5

# Using "e"

float4 = 1.5e2

print(float1)
print(float2)
print(float3)
